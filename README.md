# Goofy-Ah-NeoVim
This is a very Goofy personal configs for NeoVim

This is my very goofy neovim config for a teenager that don't speak english, use dvorak and dosen't have de ESC key on the keyboard (it's borke).

It has some **QUESTIONABLE** keyboard shortcuts and a lot of plugins with default files.

I wrote the entire configuration with a Unix-based system in mind, and the last clarification is that I use the [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) because [lualine](https://www.github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) or [nvimtree](https://www.github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) use a lot of special icons.
